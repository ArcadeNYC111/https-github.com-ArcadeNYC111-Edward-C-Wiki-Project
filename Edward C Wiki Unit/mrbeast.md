Jimmy has become an extremely popular YouTuber in recent years. He is known for giving away lots of money, making people do challenges and tasks for money, and buying large objects.[2]

The channel is mostly run by Jimmy and three of his best friends Nolan Hansen, Karl Jacobs, and Chandler Hallow, who makes experiments, challenges, or donations that usually involve money. Currently, his main channel is the most subscribed individual YouTuber, the most subscribed overall, and most viewed individual YouTuber with over 300 million subscribers and 53.8 billion views, as of July 10, 2024. He started this YouTube channel on February 19, 2012, at the age of 13.

He also has a second channel called Beast Reacts (formerly BeastHacks, Mr.Beast, Mr.Beast CSGO, GIANT ASIAN STICKER, and Rock Paper Scissors) where Jimmy and his friends react and review things like compilations and roast them if they are disgusting or bad. In May of 2020, he started a gaming channel named MrBeast Gaming, which has over 44 million subscribers, releasing 1 gaming video every couple of months. He also has the channel MrBeast 2 (formerly MrBeast Shorts) where he uploads around 10-60 second clips of him and his friends doing random things, and some of those videos are posted on his TikTok.

Along with a Playbutton-focused English YouTuber JackSucksAtLife, he created the channel Don’t Subscribe, and he gives ten cents to Jack for every subscriber. As of August 20th, 2021, the channel has 1 Million subscribers, meaning Jack has made $1,000,000,000. This is the limit to the amount of money he can make. Despite Jack co-owning the channel, Jack doesn't have access to it. Also, Jack says in some of his videos "Subscribe to Don't Subscribe".

His brother, CJ Donaldson, also has a channel inspired by his brother, called CjTheseDays (formerly known as MrBro). He started his channel in 2017 but only started posting in August of 2019. He also makes challenge videos, like his brother does.

Jimmy is also known for making fun of Minecraft, a game developed by Mojang. He made a two-episode series playing it and was finished playing the game for good after his house got blown up by a creeper. Due to that incident, he has since deleted the game. Since then, Jimmy has made a sudden return to Minecraft, collaborating with fellow YouTuber Dream in the video titled "3 Minecraft Speedrunners VS Hunter ft. MrBeast" featured on Dream's YouTube channel.

It seems like Jimmy is starting to like Minecraft more than he did a few years back. He has since made a channel called MrBeast Gaming, where he does challenges with his viewers and his friends for money. The challenges are usually in Minecraft and involve parkour, building or fighting, usually for money, gift cards, food, and for no reason. One of the stranger prizes was a free supply of yogurt for a decade.

One challenge done on the gaming channel was the $100,000 gift card hunt on the Dream SMP. The prize was $100,000 worth of gift cards from different stores. The challenge was ultimately won by Tubbo, who decided to selflessly give away all of his earnings on one of his livestreams.

In June 15, 2023, 3 days before Titan started it’s descent in June 18, in a post, Jimmy tweeted, “I was invited earlier this month to ride the Titanic submarine. I said no. Kind of scary that I could have been on it.” Moreover, he shared a screenshot of an iMessage he received: “Also, I’m going to the Titanic in a submarine late this month. The team would be stoked to have you along,” it said.” Another cut-off line of text followed, saying, "I'm sure you’re also welcome to join."
