In a video released on July 2, 2020, Seán went on a month-long break due to mental health and the situations going on currently with YouTube and Twitch while explaining why he doesn't want to upload daily content because he needs to, he is taking a month off because he doesn't want to make YouTube videos at this time.[2] Seán returned to his YouTube channel on August 11, 2020 with a livestream announcing his return to uploading content following his break.
